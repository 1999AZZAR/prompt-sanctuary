# Prompt-Sanctuary

Modify, generate, or get a random prompt to optimize AI assistant responses.

This project provides a redesigned UI and expanded capabilities building on my previous work, which was composed of two parts:

- [Prompt Library](https://github.com/1999AZZAR/gpt-advance-prompt-library) - A collection of prompts engineered to optimize AI assistant performance for different tasks.

- [Prompt Generator](https://github.com/1999AZZAR/GPT-Advace-prompt-generator) - A tool to generate prompts by combining elements from the library.

With this new implementation, users can:

- Access the prompt library to copy proven prompts for their use case.

- Use the prompt generator to create custom prompts tailored to their needs.

- Get randomly generated prompts for experimentation.

- Provide feedback on prompts to continuously improve the library.

You can try the redesigned interface at [this link](https://sanctuary01.pythonanywhere.com/) or run it yourself by following the instructions [here](instruction.md).
