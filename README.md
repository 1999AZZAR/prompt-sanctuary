# Prompt-Sanctuary

Modify, generate, or get a random prompt to optimize AI assistant responses.

This project provides a redesigned UI and expanded capabilities building on my previous work, which was composed of three parts:

- [Prompt Library](https://github.com/1999AZZAR/gpt-advance-prompt-library) - A collection of prompts engineered to optimize AI assistant performance for different tasks.

- [Prompt Generator](https://github.com/1999AZZAR/prompt-generator) - A tool to generate prompts by combining elements from the library.

- [stability chat](https://github.com/1999AZZAR/stability_chat_bot) - A chatbot web app built with flask to generate image using stability api and text using gemini.

With this new implementation, users can:

- Access the prompt library to copy proven prompts for their use case.

- Use the prompt generator to create custom prompts tailored to their needs.

- Get randomly generated prompts for experimentation.

- Provide feedback on prompts to continuously improve the library.

- ability to save the generated prompt.

> You can try the tools yourself at [**prompt sanctuary**](https://sanctuary01.pythonanywhere.com/) or run(host) it yourself by following the instructions [here](instruction.md).
> u also can try the [**streamlit**](https://github.com/1999AZZAR/streamlit_promptgen) version if u whan to.
